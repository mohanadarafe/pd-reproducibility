# Parkinson Disease reproducibility
The following project is dedicated to test methodological variability in early-Parkinson disease detection via Machine Learning.


## Setup
In order to run the code, make sure you have Conda installed in your machine in order to use our environment. From there, run the following commands

```
conda env create --name reproducibility --file=environment.yml
conda activate reproducibility
```

Once you have your environment setup, you can run the machine learning pipeline using:

```
cd ml
python run.py
```

**Warning: this operation could take weeks to run if running on a single computer!**

## Meeting Notes
The following log is dedicated to keep track of meetings & discussions from the authors of this project. They can be found [here](https://github.com/mohanadarafe/pd-reproducibility/blob/main/MEETING_LOGS.md).
