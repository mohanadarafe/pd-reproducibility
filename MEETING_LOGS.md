# Meeting Notes
The following log is dedicated to keep track of meetings & discussions from the authors of this project.

## January 11th, 2022
In this meeting, we discussed the potential scientific question we will ask for the thesis. The workflow will compromise of using Lydia Chougar's *Automated Categorization of Parkinsonian Syndromes Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in a Clinical Setting* pipeline for predicting the progression of Parkinson's disease as per Zhen-Yu Shu's paper.

Additionally, JB suggested to do feature histograms in order to validate the output of FreeSurfer's volumes measured.

The goal for next meeting is to advance on the ML pipeline.
